# Anti-Mosquito-System-Using-TinyML

Anti-Mosquito System using TinyML

Overview

This project demonstrates how TinyML can be employed to create a real-time mosquito detection and repellent system. By utilizing sound-based mosquito identification, this device can effectively identify mosquito activity and take immediate action to repel them. The system runs on low-power microcontrollers, making it a compact and sustainable solution.

Features

Sound-based mosquito detection: Uses a trained TinyML model to recognize mosquito wingbeat frequencies.
Compact and energy-efficient: Runs on microcontrollers like Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense, ESP32, or similar boards.
Automated repellent activation: Triggers ultrasonic repellers, fans, or other mechanisms to deter mosquitoes.
Scalable and customizable: Can be adapted for various environments, from homes to outdoor areas.

How It Works

Audio Data Collection: Records mosquito wingbeat sounds using a microphone module.
Model Training: Uses machine learning frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow Lite for Microcontrollers) to train a model on mosquito sound patterns.
Real-time Inference: Deploys the trained model to a microcontroller for real-time detection.
Repellent Activation: Upon detection, the system activates a repellent mechanism such as ultrasonic waves or physical barriers.
